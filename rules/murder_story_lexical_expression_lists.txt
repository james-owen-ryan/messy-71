% The following "lexical expressions" were authored by Theresa Chen and Piper Welch during
% the 2020-21 academic year at Carleton College. The project was undertaken with James
% Ryan, then a visiting assistant professor in the Computer Science department at
% Carleton, where Theresa and Piper were members of his research group, the Studio
% for ((Computational Media) Archaeology), or SCMA.

% The lexical expressions here specify how various simulation entities may be referred to in
% natural language, using the format introduced in Klein et al. (1971). They pertain to a simulation
% that produces murder "mysteries" transpiring in the course of a dinner party. It extends the partially
% implemented generator presented in Klein et al. (1971) by using the same characters and many of the
% same initial conditions for the storyworld. This system also takes inspiration from the completed story
% generator presented in Klein et al. (1973).
