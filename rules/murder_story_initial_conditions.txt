% The following simulation initial conditions were authored by Theresa Chen and Piper Welch
% during the 2020-21 academic year at Carleton College. The project was undertaken with James
% Ryan, then a visiting assistant professor in the Computer Science department at
% Carleton, where Theresa and Piper were members of his research group, the Studio
% for ((Computational Media) Archaeology), or SCMA.

% The conditions here define the initial state of a simulation that produces murder "mysteries"
% transpiring in the course of a dinner party. It extends the partially implemented generator
% presented in Klein et al. (1971) by using the same characters and many of the same initial
% conditions for the storyworld. This system also takes inspiration from the completed story
% generator presented in Klein et al. (1973).
